## What is this?
   
<p>This is a fully standalone script that allows players to use their wheel & pedals in FiveM without needing to use Scripthook or controller emulation.</p>

With this resource, you will be able to do the following:

- Wheel & Pedal Support.
- Wheel, Pedal, and Controls Display.
- Works with any wheel / pedal combo, and allows you to choose your device.
- Change Input Indexes.
- Modify Wheel Deadzone.
- Bind both Controller and Command Actions.
- Locally saved settings.
- Completely standalone, just plug-and-play!

## What do I need?

Nothing at all! 
Just add the resource to the server, make sure the resource is started as "pickle_wheel", and have fun!

## Basic Usage

To pull up the wheel panel, use "/wheel" in the chat.
You'll need to select your device from the dropdown, and save the settings after you've tuned it to your liking.
